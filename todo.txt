--- To Do -----------------------

- Points counter
- Separate render layers
    Objects > Tiles > Decorative tiles > Background

Level editor
- Separate gameplay mode from the editor
- Undo/redo functionality
- Automatically populate placeable tiles/objects
- Animate objects when hovered in selection menu

Known bugs
- Sometimes object collision code will run multiple times in cases where one of the objects isn't immediately made intangible
- setTimeout and setInterval disregard game speed and whether or not the game is paused
- Sprites will spontaneously despawn but remain on the screen, including the player


--- Low priority ----------------

- Mario is too slippery on the ground
    Friction/traction different?
    mario should still take time to turn with higher ground friction


--- Temporary fix ---------------
- Big sprite support
- Camera panning
- Treat off-screen tiles that are above as Air


--- Done (New - old) ------------

- Power ups
- Varying jump height depending on how long the jump button is held
- Coins
- Death
    + When falling off bottom of screen
    + Lives
