--- To Do -----------------------
- Big mario + powerups
- Points counter
- Coins
- Sometimes object collision code will run multiple times in cases where one of the objects isn't immediately made intangible

Notes:
- setTimeout and setInterval disregard game speed and whether or not the game is paused


--- Low priority ----------------

- Mario is too slippery on the ground
    Friction/traction different?
    mario should still take time to turn with higher ground friction


--- Temporary fix ---------------
- Camera panning
- Treat off-screen tiles that are above as Air


--- Done ------------------------

- Death
    + When falling off bottom of screen
    + Lives
