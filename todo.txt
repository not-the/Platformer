--- To Do -----------------------

- Separate render layers
    0 Background
    1 Decoration tiles
    2 Hidey enemies (Piranha Plant, Mario while entering a pipe)
    3 Normal tiles
    4 Physics Objects
    5 HUD

- Separate tile collision property from object interaction (bullet bill doesnt deal damage with collision disabled)
- Points counter

Level editor
- Separate gameplay mode from the editor
- Undo/redo functionality
- Automatically populate placeable tiles/objects
- Animate objects when hovered in selection menu

Known bugs
- Sometimes object collision code will run multiple times in cases where one of the objects isn't immediately made intangible
- setTimeout and setInterval disregard game speed and whether or not the game is paused
- You sometimes get seemingly infinite fireballs


--- Low priority ----------------

- Mario is too slippery on the ground
    Friction/traction different?
    mario should still take time to turn with higher ground friction


--- Temporary fix ---------------
- Big sprite support

--- Possibly fixed ------------
    ...


--- Done (New - old) ------------


- Camera panning
- Bullet bills shouldn't despawn if there is a tile behind them
- Sprites will spontaneously despawn but remain on the screen, including the player
- Treat off-screen tiles that are above as Air
- Power ups
- Varying jump height depending on how long the jump button is held
- Coins
- Death
    + When falling off bottom of screen
    + Lives
